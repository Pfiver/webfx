#Mongoose

Mongoose is a booking system for a wide area of events, from small to complex events over several days including meals, onsite/offsite accommodation, transport, translation, etc...

WebFx was born in the context of this project as a cross-platform development tool for both the backend and frontend.

Mongoose is actually a private project (you can't run it as it requires a database not provided here). The reason it to be here is to keep the code updated when doing refactoring in WebFx modules. It will be moved to another repository later when WebFx will reach a stable state.
